<h3>Microcute: The cutest web framework</h3>
<p><strong>Why Microcute?</strong> Does the world really need another web framework?</p>
<p>The short answer is an unequivocal <strong>no</strong>. There are plenty of microframeworks
and static site generators to keep you busy and happy for years to come. That
being said, this project was inspired by a few specific needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create content in Markdown (or html)</li>
<li>No database</li>
<li>Easy site backups (just zip it up)</li>
<li>Insanely simple core</li>
<li>Extensible via plugins</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few alternatives, but I wasn't fully happy with any of them. In
addition, Microcute was a good weekend project for me.</p>
<p>One point I want to make is that Microcute is not intended as a blogging
framework. If you want to build a blog with Microcute, you'll have extra work
to do.</p>
