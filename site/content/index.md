### Microcute: The cutest web framework

**Why Microcute?** Does the world really need another web framework?

The short answer is an unequivocal **no**. There are plenty of microframeworks
and static site generators to keep you busy and happy for years to come. That
being said, this project was inspired by a few specific needs:

* Create content in Markdown (or html)
* No database
* Easy site backups (just zip it up)
* Insanely simple core
* Extensible via plugins

There are a few alternatives, but I wasn't fully happy with any of them. In
addition, Microcute was a good weekend project for me.

One point I want to make is that Microcute is not intended as a blogging
framework. If you want to build a blog with Microcute, you'll have extra work
to do.
